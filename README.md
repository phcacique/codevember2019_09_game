## About this app
![preview image](/images/09_game.PNG)

I always wanted to created a game with a circular movement. This is a first attempt to create a joystick added to the screen only when the user is pressing. It is positioned on the finger's position. Use it to control the movement direction (CW or CCW) and tap to jump. It is not a full game, just testing things like gravity fields, collecting items and of course the movement.

_This is an iOS app, made in Swift, on XCode and it is a free visual experiment._
